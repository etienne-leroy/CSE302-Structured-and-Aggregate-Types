CSE302 - Final Project - Structured and Aggregate Types

Etienne Leroy, Amine Roudani, Lucas Nelson


	- Extending the parser to handle BX pointers and arrays - Etienne (for now)

		To achieve this objective, we first modified the lexer (bxlexer.py). We added 4 tokens for the left and right brackets ([]), the ampersand (&), 
		and times (*), in order to handle pointers and arrays.

		

	- Type checking BX pointers and arrays - Amine (for now)

	- Extending TAC with 'load' and 'store' instructions - Lucas (for now)

	- Emitting x64 for these Extensions - we'll figure it out
