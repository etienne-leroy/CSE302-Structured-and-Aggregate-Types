	- Extending the parser to handle BX pointers and arrays - Etienne (for now)

		To achieve this objective, we first modified the lexer (bxlexer.py). We added new tokens for punctuation and keywords to handle the new pointers and arrays.

		To extend the parser, we define new types for pointers and arrays, as well as definitions for the null pointer, referencing, alloc, assignables, etc.
		


		

	- Type checking BX pointers and arrays : 

	- Extending TAC with 'load' and 'store' instructions :

	- Emitting x64 for these Extensions :
